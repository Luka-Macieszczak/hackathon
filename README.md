This project is built for uOttaHack 5. It is a chrome extension that compares the 
price of an item on an initial website to the prices of the same item on eBay.
It does this by displaying a dropdown showing the price of the item in the extension. For more
information, the user can click the extension and it will bring them to the eBay page.

## Accessibility Features (on the way!):
- Adjustable Font Size
- Dark Mode
- Text to Speech Support
- Help Panels
